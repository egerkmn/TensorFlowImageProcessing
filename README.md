# TensorFlowImageProcessing

In this project, I will build an end-to-end machine learning solution using a convolutional neural network(CNN) for house price prediction problem via TensorFlow.

The dataset contains 535 house images showing 4 different parts of each house (bathroom, livingroom, exterior, kitchen) and the aim is to predict the price of each house by using the images provided. Mean Squared Error(MSE), Mean Absolute Error(MAE), and Mean Absolute Percent Error(MAPE) are used as evaluation metrics. I will also try to share the reasoning behind my choices.

We will go through 5 steps:
1) **Preparing Libraries and Data:** Obtaining the dataset 
2) **Preprocessing the Data:** Dealing with pixels and scaling the target
3) **Evaluation Metric and Base Score:** Evaluation metrics and base score assumption
4) **Building the Convolutional Neural Network for Regression:** Implementing TensorFlow CNN model
5) **Model Results and Evaluation:** Making comments on the model results

More details are given in the Jupyter Notebook.
